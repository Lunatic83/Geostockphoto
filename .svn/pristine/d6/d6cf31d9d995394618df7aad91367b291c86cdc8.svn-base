		<h1>Guide for the<br> submission and evaluation<br> of the photos</h1>
		Geostockphoto believes and relies on the contributions of its community.
		This guide is designed to convey to the photographers and evaluators of GeoStockPhoto
		the guidelines to be followed according to the needs of the buyers.
		Here you will find information on types of photos and quality requirements in 4 areas:
		info and location, technique, composition and legal.
		
		<h4 class="orange" style="text-align: left; margin: 30px 0 0 0">Info and position</h4>
		<dl>
			<dt>Accuracy of location</dt>
				<dd class="ko">Avoid editing more than one photo in the same geographical position unless the subject
					was actually taken from the same position.</dd>
				<dd class="ok">Verify the correct position by the "satellite" view of the map.</dd>
				<dd class="ok">In valuation, take account of the <i>accuracy</i> of the photographer. If you can not
					establish the correct position of the picture, trust photographers with <i>accuracy</i> greater than or equal to 95%.</dd>
			<dt>Title and description</dt>
				<dd class="ko">Do not insert general information, for example, do not write only the name of the city if the photo
					portrays a particular monument.</dd>
				<dd class="ok">Enter as much information as possible. For example, if the subject is a bird or a plant,
					also define the species.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h4 class="orange" style="text-align: left; margin: 30px 0 0 0">Technique</h4>
		<dl>
			<dt>Focus</dt>
				<dd class="ok">The subject of the photo must always be clearly focused. In general you can apply the rule of having
					sharp eyes of a model or animal and the entire field in the case of landscapes.
					Check the focus by displaying the 100% crop of the photo.</dd>
			<dt>Light</dt>
				<dd class="ko">The photos must not be over or under exposed. For example, photos
					with white skies (overexposed) or too dark shadows (underexposed) are not acceptable.
					Check the correct exposure with a histogram.</dd>
			<dt>Noise</dt>
				<dd class="ko">Do not use too high ISO. Even for some reflex, taking pictures over ISO 200
					produces an annoying noise.
					Check the noise through the 100% crop of the photo.</dd>
				<dd class="ok">If shooting at night or you need to use long times anyway,
					use a tripod.</dd>
			<dt>Filter and post-production</dt>
				<dd class="ko">Avoid pictures in black and white. A buyer can buy a color photo, and then convert it
					to black and white but he can not do the opposite.</dd>
				<dd class="ko">Avoid post-productions that ruin the quality of the photo. HDR photos are fine
					only within certain limits.</dd>
				<dd class="ko">Avoid filters that alter the reality of the subject.</dd>
				<dd class="ko">It is absolutely forbidden to have frames or signatures in the photos.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h4 class="orange" style="text-align: left; margin: 30px 0 0 0">Composition</h4>
		<dl>
			<dt>Studio</dt>
				<dd class="ko">The photos must not have been taken in a photography studio otherwise they would lose the characteristic
					of belonging to a certain place.</dd>
				<dd class="ko">To avoid photos with white background.</dd>
			<dt>Similarity</dt>
				<dd class="ko">Upload only your best photos. If you upload a lot of similar photos (or photos already
					present in GeoStockPhoto) the evaluation could decrease.</dd>
			<dt>Marketability</dt>
				<dd class="ko">For all photos the marketability factor must be taken into account (a famous monument can be sold more
					easily than an anonymous tree).</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h4 class="orange" style="text-align: left; margin: 30px 0 0 0">Legal</h4>
		<dl>
			<dt>Portrayed people</dt>
				<dd class="ko">In the act of submitting a photo, the author declares to have all the releases relevant
					to the people portrayed therein (it is not necessary that such releases are uploaded on GeoStockPhoto
					but it is necessary to keep them for the purpose of being showed, if so requested at any time by GeoStockPhoto).
					Please keep in mind that the release is not requested only in case the photo has publishing purpose and hence
					reproduces famous people or people caught in the context of a public event.</dd>
			<dt>Trademarks</dt>
				<dd class="ko">On GeoStockPhoto you cannot upload photos containing trademarks and/or any element covered
					by intellectual property rights, including copyright (unless you own the rights thereof).</dd>
			<dt>Protected Buildings</dt>
				<dd class="ko">Some monuments and famous buildings are covered by copyright and the photos reproducing them
					cannot be sold. Some examples are constituted by the Eiffel Towerâ€™s nocturnal lights and by the
					Empire State Building and, moreover, many zoos and parks also expressly forbid commercial photography.
					Anyway, the building covered by copyright can appear in the photo of a skyline, provided that such
					building does not constitute its predominant part.</dd>
