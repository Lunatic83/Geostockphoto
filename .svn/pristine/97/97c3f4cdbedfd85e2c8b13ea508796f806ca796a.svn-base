<div class="sub-title">Evaluation</div>
<div class="text">
	Each picture submitted on GeoStockPhoto will be evaluated by other users,
	which, through a vote, will evaluate its suitability for sale.
	The final grade assigned to each picture will be the weighted average of the scores 
	awarded by <!-- at least two -->other users, with scores ranging from -5 to +5.
	A vote given by a Professional or Power user will be given more weight than a vote given by a 
	any registered or Newbie user. <!-- As an alternative, the GeoStockPhoto staff 
	can participate in the selection process: every vote will be sufficient to assess their suitability for sale.  -->
	In order to pass the voting system and be put up for sale,
	the photo must obtain a final mark greater than 0. The pictures uploaded by Power users
	will not be subject to the voting system.

<!-- <div class="text orange">
	At present, and until further notice by GeoStockPhoto, photographs will be judged solely by the staff of GeoStockPhoto.
